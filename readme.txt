Dear Reviewer,

Expt. 1 and 2 will require a lot of work to recreate. The current material here is not enough to recreate the experiments, but we supply the code so that you can at least see the work was done. In order to recreate the tests you will have to download the datasets etc.

For CUB you will have to fine-tune a ResNet34 to the dataset before starting, this model was far too big to include in this supplement. You also need to download the dataset.

For ImageNet you can use the pre-trained ResNet50, but you will still need to download the dataset.

However, with all this prep-work, we have supplied all the code needed to recreate our results if you wish to do so during the review process.

Of course, if the paper is published, we will give step-by-step instructions on how to recreate the tests on GitHub to make it hassle free!

Thank you,
