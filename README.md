This is the repository for the paper *"Advancing Post-Hoc Case-Based Explanation With Feature Highlighting"*[^1].

The paper was published in the main technical track at IJCAI 2023.

The paper proposes a way to augment typical example-based (i.e., case-based) explanation with feature highlighting. CNN specific and ANN agnostic approaches are proposed.
